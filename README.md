- ## 🏍️ Vision: Improving Road and Vehicle Safety in Austin, Texas

This project goes beyond data analysis. My goal is to help **improve road and vehicle safety** in the **Austin, Texas area**, with a special focus on **motorcycle driver safety**.

### Why Motorcycles?
**Motorcycle drivers face significantly higher risk of accidents and injuries** compared to other vehicle types. The data often reveals patterns and hotspots where our two-wheeled community faces the greatest dangers. By analyzing Texas car crash data, we can identify critical safety issues and work toward solutions.

## 🚀 Past Project: Rex (OnStar for Motorcycles)

Three years ago, I worked with a startup company called **Rex** on an ambitious project: **creating an OnStar-like system specifically for motorcycles**. This was a game-changing idea to provide:
- Real-time safety alerts and communication
- Emergency response coordination
- Rider tracking and assistance
- Integration with existing motorcycle navigation systems

While that project has evolved, the mission remains urgent and relevant.

## 🤝 Looking for Collaborators

I'm actively seeking **collaborators and partners** to expand on this work and bring it to the next level. If you're interested in:
- Road safety innovation
- Motorcycle safety technology
- Data-driven transportation solutions
- Austin/Texas area community initiatives

**Let's connect and make a difference!** Whether you're a data scientist, software engineer, motorcycle enthusiast, or safety advocate, your perspective could help us save lives.

📧 Reach out if you'd like to discuss collaborating on this important mission!
